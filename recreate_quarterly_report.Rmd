Trying to recreate the last quarterly report (/Users/bradcannell/Dropbox/01 Research/link2care/L2C_Quarterly_Data_Code_Files/Link2Care Quarterly Q3_2020_final.docx).

Soon, I will have to start making these myself.

# Load packages

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(readxl)
```

# Connect to UTH server

```{bash}
open 'smb://uctnascifs.uthouston.edu/sph_research/Link2Care/Live Documents/'
```

# Import data

```{r}
screened_in <- readxl::read_excel(
  "/Volumes/Live Documents/L2C_Demographics.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Screened In"
)

screened_out <- readxl::read_excel(
  "/Volumes/Live Documents/L2C_Demographics.xlsx", 
  sheet = "Screened Out"
)
```
